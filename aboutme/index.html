<p>My name is Alexander Hart, I am 20 years old and i am born and raised in Austria,Europe. Coming from a different continent provides me with a lot of knowledge of different cultures. Apparently it is quite common in the USA that people have never left the country, so they are always open for some stories. I have many stories to tell, as i have experienced the culure of over 20 countries.</p>

<h2> My Job</h2>
<p>Basically I can say that I am right now an professional athlete. I am a platform diver with a signed contract for a team, so i would call it professional. It is not easy to live an studtent athlete life. Next to the academical pressure there is the pressure from your coach, from your self and anyone that you ahve to achieve something. I am aiming big and I am not willing to give up as soon as I have some problems. This sport is more than just doing it. You have to be passionated about it, otherwise you can achieve anything. You have to give in every training more than 130%, otherwise you will never reach your goals. I just want make people aware of that, as it always seems as a "easy" sport... you just ahve to jump and spin... I want to see anyone to try it for 1 year in a team, and then let this person compete and we will see how far he will be. Spoiler alert, he will be for sure last. Anyway, just go and watch some big platform diving events on youtube or somewhere. Let the aesthetic overwhelm you and enjoy it.</p>
